# CSDP-250-Project-5
Author: Femi Adebisi
Date Created: November 25, 2023
Class: CSDP 250
Purpose:
  Create at least 35 random natural numbers (less than 100), and save it with the original In an array.
  Construct a binary search tree for the set of numbers, using a linked list.
  Display the binary search tree with the inorder DFS.
  Prompt user to delete a node and then display the updated tree with the postorder DFS.
  Test if the tree is AVL tree, using a recursive function.
  
TO COMPILE:
  if g++
    g++ main.cpp BinaryTree.cpp -o main
  if not g++
    clang++ main.cpp BinaryTree.cpp -o main
  TO RUN:
    ./main

input: random list of numbers
output: inorder and postorder search tree, if the is avl tree
